\description{
Implements the endogenous kink (EK) method proposed by Bom and Rachinger for
publication bias correction in meta-analysis. This method modifies the PET-PEESE
approach by incorporating a non-linear relationship between publication bias and
standard errors through a kinked regression specification. The method recognizes
that when the true effect is non-zero, there is minimal publication selection
when standard errors are very small (since most estimates are significant), but
selection increases as standard errors grow. The kink point is endogenously
determined using a two-step procedure based on the confidence interval of the
initial effect estimate. See
\insertCite{bom2019kinked;textual}{PublicationBiasBenchmark} for details.

# Apply EK method
result <- run_method("EK", data)
