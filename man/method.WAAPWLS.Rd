\description{
Implements the WAAP-WLS method for meta-analysis, which combines WLS and WAAP approaches.
First fits a WLS model to all studies, then identifies high-powered studies based on
the criterion that the WLS estimate divided by 2.8 is greater than or equal to the
standard error. If at least 2 high-powered studies are found, uses WAAP (weighted
average of adequate power studies only), otherwise uses the original WLS estimate.
See \insertCite{stanley2017finding;textual}{PublicationBiasBenchmark} for details.
