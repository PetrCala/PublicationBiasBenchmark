\arguments{
\item{method_name}{Method name (automatically passed)}

\description{
Implements the Andrews & Kasy (AK) method for publication bias correction in meta-analysis.
The AK method categorizes estimated effects into groups with different probabilities of being
published. AK1 uses symmetric selection grouping estimates into significant (|t| >= 1.96) and
insignificant (|t| < 1.96) estimates. AK2 uses asymmetric selection with four groups based on
both significance and sign: highly significant positive/negative effects and marginally
significant positive/negative effects, each with different publication probabilities. See
\insertCite{andrews2019identification;textual}{PublicationBiasBenchmark} for details.

\details{
The following settings are implemented \describe{
\item{\code{"default"}}{Uses AK1 estimator (symmetric selection)}
\item{\code{"AK1"}}{Symmetric selection model grouping estimates into significant
(|t| >= 1.96) and insignificant (|t| < 1.96) categories with relative publication
probabilities of 1 and p1 respectively.}
\item{\code{"AK2"}}{Asymmetric selection model with four groups based on t-statistics:
(a) t >= 1.96, (b) t < -1.96, (c) -1.96 <= t < 0, and (d) 0 <= t < 1.96, with
relative publication probabilities of 1, p1, p2, and p3 respectively.}
